Here is my (Zaynn) shell/bash Tool Box, mainly used for Linux. 


## Usage :

To use this tool box properly and easily, you need to be able to access its content quickly and from everywhere.
To do so you have the *import_tools.sh* script.

To use it it is recommanded to add this to your .bashrc :
```bash

source {your path here}/import_tools.sh {your path here}

```
See the import_tools.sh documentation for more details and options.
